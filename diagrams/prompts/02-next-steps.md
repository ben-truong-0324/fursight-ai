# Project Next Steps & Chosen Path

## I. User Goal
The user wants to continue building out the cluster with a focus on "thoroughness" and "best-in-class" architecture before deploying more application code.

## II. Potential Architectural Improvements
We identified three key areas for improvement to mimic a production environment:
1.  **Monitoring & Alerting:** With Prometheus & Grafana.
2.  **Centralized Logging:** With Loki & Promtail.
3.  **GitOps Automation:** With ArgoCD or Flux.

## III. Chosen Path
The user has selected **Path A: Strengthen the Platform** and wants to begin with Monitoring.

### **Path A: Strengthen the Platform**
1.  **Install & Configure Prometheus:** Deploy the `kube-prometheus-stack` Helm chart, which is the industry standard for setting up a full monitoring solution.
2.  **Access Grafana:** Expose the Grafana service via a secure Ingress, just as we did for the Traefik dashboard.
3.  **Explore Dashboards:** Log in to Grafana and explore the default dashboards to visualize the state of our cluster and applications.

### **Path B: Build the Application (To be done after Path A)**
1.  **Create FastAPI Backend:** Create a simple "Hello World" FastAPI application.
2.  **Containerize & Ship:** Write a `Dockerfile` for the Python app, build it, and import it into the `k3d` cluster.
3.  **Deploy with Helm:** Create a new Helm chart for the FastAPI backend.
4.  **Integrate:** Configure the Next.js frontend to make an API call to the FastAPI backend via its internal Kubernetes service name.
