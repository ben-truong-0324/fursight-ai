## IV. Next Steps
With a robust application and AI inference platform in place, we have a clear roadmap for building a sophisticated, end-to-end AI application stack.

* **Path D: LangChain Ecosystem Integration:** The immediate next step is to build on our raw model serving capabilities. We will deploy and integrate the LangChain ecosystem, including `LangServe` for deploying chains, `LangGraph` for building complex, stateful agentic workflows, and connecting everything to `LangSmith` for detailed tracing and observability.

* **Path E: Strengthen Observability:** With more complex services running, we will circle back to our monitoring stack. We'll integrate the LangChain components and the vLLM servers with Prometheus and build custom Grafana dashboards to visualize performance, trace data, and key application metrics.

* **Path F: AI Application Integration:** We will connect our core applications to the new AI capabilities. This involves modifying the `frontend-nextjs` and `backend-fastapi` applications to communicate with the services deployed via LangServe, building a user-facing feature that leverages our AI chains and agents.

* **Path G: Introduce GitOps:** We will formalize our deployment process by setting up a GitOps controller like Flux or Argo CD. This will automate syncing the state of our cluster with the manifests declared in a Git repository.

* **Path H: Advanced Networking:** We will evolve our ingress layer into a more powerful API Gateway. This will involve exploring more advanced traffic shaping, routing, authentication, and rate-limiting strategies to manage the APIs exposed by our various services.

* **Path I: Stateful Services:** To support more complex applications, we will deploy and manage stateful services within the cluster, such as databases (e.g., PostgreSQL) and messaging queues (e.g., RabbitMQ or NATS).
